# DICOM-based-Standard-for-Quantitative-Physical-Rehabilitation

## Description

This repository showcase a proof of concept of the DICOM data format with PR (Physical Rehabiliation) data, for the Virtual Glove assistive system for the QPR (Quantitative Physical Rehabilitation) of the hand. The principal objective of this code is to demonstrate the efficacy of employing DICOM format for PR data without requiring substantial adjustments.
